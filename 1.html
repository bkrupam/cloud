</xmp>
    
    <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
<xmp>    
Part 1: Inter-Process Communication using Python Sockets
Task 1: Simple Client-Server Application
Server Code (Python):
import socket


def simple_server():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('localhost', 5000))
    server_socket.listen(1)
    
    print("Server is listening on port 5000...")
    
    connection, address = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Connection from {address} has been established.")


    client_message = connection.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
    print(f"Client says: {client_message}")
    
    server_message = "Hello from the server!"
    connection.sendall(server_message.encode('utf-8'))
    
    connection.close()
    server_socket.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    simple_server()



Client Code (Python):
import socket


def simple_client():
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect(('localhost', 5000))
    
    client_message = "Hello from the client!"
    client_socket.sendall(client_message.encode('utf-8'))


    server_message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
    print(f"Server says: {server_message}")
    
    client_socket.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    simple_client()

    Task 2: Enhanced Communication with Data Transfer (Sending and Receiving Objects)
    In this task, we modify the client-server application to send and receive custom objects using Python's pickle module, which allows serialization of objects.
    Server Code (Python with Object Transfer):
    import socket
    import pickle
    
    
    class CustomObject:
        def __init__(self, name, value):
            self.name = name
            self.value = value
    
    
    def enhanced_server():
        server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        server_socket.bind(('localhost', 5000))
        server_socket.listen(1)
        
        print("Server is listening on port 5000...")
        
        connection, address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {address} has been established.")
    
    
        # Receive object
        data = connection.recv(4096)
        received_object = pickle.loads(data)
        print(f"Received object: Name = {received_object.name}, Value = {received_object.value}")
    
    
        # Send response object
        response_object = CustomObject("ResponseObject", 123)
        connection.sendall(pickle.dumps(response_object))
        
        connection.close()
        server_socket.close()
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        enhanced_server()
    
    
    
    Client Code (Python with Object Transfer):
    import socket
    import pickle
    
    
    class CustomObject:
        def __init__(self, name, value):
            self.name = name
            self.value = value
    
    
    def enhanced_client():
        client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.connect(('localhost', 5000))
        
        # Create and send custom object
        client_object = CustomObject("ClientObject", 42)
        client_socket.sendall(pickle.dumps(client_object))
    
    
        # Receive response object
        data = client_socket.recv(4096)
        response_object = pickle.loads(data)
        print(f"Server response: Name = {response_object.name}, Value = {response_object.value}")
        
        client_socket.close()
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        enhanced_client()
    
    
    
    Part 2: Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
    Although Python doesn’t have a native RMI system like Java, the equivalent would be using XML-RPC or Pyro4 to implement remote method invocation. Below is an example using Pyro4.
    First, you need to install Pyro4:
    pip install Pyro4
    Task 1: Create an RMI Service
    RMI Server Code (Python using Pyro4):
    import Pyro4
    
    
    # Create a class for the remote service
    @Pyro4.expose
    class RemoteService:
        def say_hello(self, name):
            return f"Hello, {name}! This is the RMI server."
    
    
    def start_server():
        # Start the Pyro4 Daemon
        daemon = Pyro4.Daemon()  # Pyro4 daemon
        ns = Pyro4.locateNS()  # Locate the name server
        uri = daemon.register(RemoteService)  # Register the service
        ns.register("example.rmi", uri)  # Register the service with a name in the name server
    
    
        print(f"RMI Server started with URI: {uri}")
        daemon.requestLoop()  # Start the event loop for listening
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        start_server()
    
    
    
    RMI Client Code (Python using Pyro4):
    import Pyro4
    
    
    def rmi_client():
        # Locate the RMI server by the name 'example.rmi'
        remote_service = Pyro4.Proxy("PYRONAME:example.rmi")
        
        # Call the remote method
        response = remote_service.say_hello("Client")
        print(f"Server says: {response}")
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        rmi_client()
    
    
    
    
        Running the Pyro4-based RMI Application:
    
        Start the name server by running:
    
        python -m Pyro4.naming
    
        Run the server code (RMI Server), which will register the service and wait for requests.
    
        Run the client code (RMI Client), which will connect to the server and invoke the remote method.

<h3>EX4 Clock and Time Synchronization in Distributed Computing</h3>
<xmp>
Objective:
To understand and implement logical clocks and vector clocks in distributed systems.
To explore how clock synchronization helps maintain consistent order of events in distributed systems.

Part 1: Logical Clocks

Task 1: Implement Logical Clocks Using Lamport’s Logical Clock
Description: Implement a simple distributed system with multiple processes that use Lamport’s Logical Clock to order events. Each process will increment its logical clock and send time-stamped messages to other processes.

Part 2: Vector Clocks

Task 1: Implement Vector Clocks
Description: Implement vector clocks to handle more complex scenarios where multiple processes can be in concurrent states. Vector clocks help in determining the partial ordering of events and detecting causality.
